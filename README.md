Been doing full stack web dev professionally for over 10 years. These days mostly work remotely through [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0105010563c7284e42).

My open source contributions are few but I'm still proud of them:

I've dabbled with compilers in my free time, the most real-life result being [my contributions to the Roslyn analyzers](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/commits/main?author=tkharaishvili) repo which is basically a linter for .NET.

I've also made a [small contribution to Caesar 3](https://github.com/Keriew/augustus/commits/master?author=tkharaishvili), a game I used to play in my childhood. My younger self would especially be proud of that one ðŸ˜Š

I use React on the front-end and C#/.NET in the back. I'm not married to these technologies though. The prospect of learning something new still sparks my enthusiasm after all these years of coding. So if you've got something delicious cooking, feel free to reach out!
